# Why Zettelkasten? 

## The three pillars behind Zettelkasten that make it work

- Fluid structure
- Interlinking
- Externalization

### 1. Fluid structure

Having a fluid structure means that when I create a note I don't have to deal with the dilemma of topic categorization.

Which means I don't need to create folder structures for topics, because by creating notes and interlinking ideas the topics will be created by themselves. Overtime the system become more structured, you just have to create and link ideas.

### 2. Interlinking

Means that Zettelkasten encourages you to see the connection between different ideas.

When you have an opportunity to see the connection between different seemly unrelated concepts and facts it helps you to generate even more insightful ideas, and to develop understanding of general principles.

### 3. Externalization

Zettelkasten forces you to take everything that's inside your head and put it on the paper (in the general sense; you can use any software you like).

Such externalization of knowledge have important benefits. A good one is clarity of a subject: meaning that you can explain (your) ideas to other people. This way you can detect blind spots in your understanding.
